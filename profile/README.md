# Sigma Force

<details>
  <summary>ChatGPT's Intro:</summary>
Once upon a time, in the vast digital realm, there existed a notorious hacker group known as Sigma Force. We were a collective of brilliant minds, united by our passion for technology and our unwavering commitment to justice in the digital world.

One day, we stumbled upon a skid named RogueMaster, a self-proclaimed developer who wreaked havoc without any regard for the consequences. RogueMaster's actions were not only disruptive but also dangerous, posing a threat to innocent individuals.

Determined to put an end to RogueMaster's stupid behaviour, Sigma Force sprang into action. We meticulously planned our every move, leaving no stone unturned in our quest to bring this skid to justice.

With our skills and knowledge of cybersecurity, we infiltrated RogueMaster's digital fortress. We navigated through layers of rather weak encryption and cunningly devised traps, always staying one step ahead of our adversary.

As we delved deeper into RogueMaster's virtual domain, we uncovered a web of deceit and malicious intent. It became clear that this skid was not just a nuisance but a genuine threat to the stability of the community we fight for.

Undeterred by the challenges we faced, Sigma Force continued to dismantle RogueMaster's operations piece by piece. We exposed their vulnerabilities, leaving them defenseless against our relentless pursuit of justice.

### The team:

- On github:
  - @marcus-alicia: Team Lead & planning
  - @warnerfuckers: Development
  - @Clwning: Development
  - @MrGambet: Help
  - @Xxxosmo: Ideas
- Off-site:
  - AutisticGhost: Monitoring Infrastructure
  - Hand Banana: Infrastructure
  - n/a: Consultant

### The objective:

Make sure that skids get what they deserve. Selling builds (Yes, you are. You have confirmed certain assets not to be public yourself) is against the license (we have you admit to that on recording). Taking, taking & taking while never contributing back is a scumbag move. Frivolous claims against other community leaders is wrong, if not illegal depending on where you live.

### The execution:

1. <b>De-value</b> the patreon by releasing all builds to the public the second they go live. Including custom animation sets.
2. <b>De-platform</b> by filing appropriate claims in the name of the damaged.
3. <b>Slow down</b> their workflow, forcing them to take alternate routes time and time again.
4. <b>Have fun</b> with the baby stuck in a mans body.

### The future:

The community has more than one black sheep. Dont worry, we will be coming for *you* next, once we fully understand your inner workings and how to hurt you.

### Words from the authors:

As always, we are not affiliated with anyone. Whoever claims responsibility for these accounts, attacks, ideas or otherwise unmentioned but related actions is a **liar**. We do not de-anonymize ourselves. We aren't complete morons. We are a silent group in the background, showing ourselves whenever needed, with a clean image that fits the target.
